# Changelog: Pure Duolingo-Style Learning

## Commit bcb9c4f - Make progressive learning the default and only mode

### Problem Identified
User feedback: "its still not like duolingo the user should not be choosing if they got it right or wrong it should be four choices and the user selects what they think is true"

### Root Cause
The CLI tool was offering two modes:
1. Traditional Flashcard (where users marked answers as correct/wrong themselves)
2. Progressive Learning (Duolingo-style with 4 multiple choice)

Users were confused by the choice and could still access the old "correct/wrong" mode.

### Solution Implemented
**Removed mode selection entirely** - Progressive Learning (4 multiple choice) is now the ONLY mode.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Welcome Message Updated
```diff
- üöÄ LEETCODE PRACTICE TOOL - FLASHCARD GAME

+ üöÄ LEETCODE PRACTICE TOOL - DUOLINGO-STYLE
+ Build solutions step-by-step with multiple choice questions.
```

#### 2. Main Menu Updated
```diff
- 1. üéØ Start Practice Session
+ 1. üéØ Start Practice Session (Duolingo-style)
```

#### 3. Mode Selection Removed
```diff
- # Ask user to choose practice mode
- display_mode_selection_menu()
- mode_choice = get_user_choice(3)
- if mode_choice == 1:
-     # Traditional flashcard mode
-     run_practice_session()
- elif mode_choice == 2:
-     # Progressive learning mode
-     game.enable_progressive_mode(True)
-     run_progressive_practice_session()
+ # Directly start Progressive Learning
+ game.enable_progressive_mode(True)
+ run_progressive_practice_session()
```

#### 4. Help Text Updated
Removed all references to:
- "correct/wrong/skip" commands
- "Traditional Flashcard" mode
- Choosing if you got it right

Added focus on:
- 4 multiple choice options
- Selecting 1-4
- Automatic correctness checking
- Section-by-section learning

### User Experience

#### Before
```
1. Start app
2. Choose filters
3. Choose mode (Traditional vs Progressive) ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFUSING
4. If Traditional: Mark correct/wrong yourself ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT DUOLINGO-STYLE

```

#### After
```
1. Start app
2. Choose filters
3. Automatically in Progressive mode ‚úì NO CHOICE NEEDED
4. Always 4 multiple choice options ‚úì PURE DUOLINGO-STYLE
5. System checks correctness automatically ‚úì
```

### Testing
- ‚úÖ All 13 progressive learning tests pass
- ‚úÖ CLI tool imports correctly
- ‚úÖ User experience verified: 4 choices per section
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to backend

### Result
**The tool is now PURE Duolingo-style learning:**
- No mode selection
- No "correct/wrong" commands
- Just 4 multiple choice options
- Automatic feedback
- Section-by-section progression
- Exactly what the user requested!

## Files Modified
- `flashcard_game.py` (26 additions, 33 deletions)
  - Welcome message
  - Main menu
  - Help text
  - Removed mode selection logic
  - Removed traditional flashcard mode

## Backward Compatibility
The traditional flashcard mode (`run_practice_session()`) still exists in the codebase but is no longer accessible through the CLI interface. It can be restored if needed for other purposes, but users will only see the Duolingo-style experience.
